Code Clinic: Java with Patrick Royal

Problem One: Exploring Lake Pend Oreille

Extended the Code Clinic on data analysis to work on new website format.
The new website http://lpo.dt.navy.mil/data/ no longer contains a convenient directory format, but just four text files for 2011-2014. As a result, the exercise involves a lot more string parsing.

New features:
- Implemented basic error checking
- Converted all computations to BigDecimal considering the floating point inaccuracies
- Added a graphing functionality that allows user to visualize data as a simple bar graph. Used with JFreeChart library
